Have you ever had such an experience, after the order entry only a little profit, obviously less than the stop-loss position want to close the position, because insist on holding the position requires a lot of psychological pressure, this time if you close the position, psychologically immediately to get the satisfaction of the bag.

The moment of closing the position is very cool, but if you continue to watch the market run, but very regret to close the position too early, angry straight shoot thighs.

There is a lot of this in trading, just like when you swipe a short video and get instant gratification but waste time and gain nothing.

Focus on the process rather than the outcome and learn to postpone gratification

The right thing to do is to change our thinking and understand that you are not just trading this one time in your life, you need to trade thousands and thousands of times, so under such a huge volume of trading, your trade this time is just one of the points, its profit and loss results do not affect the whole surface at all.

So the loss, on the ruthless stop loss, profit on the insistence on holding positions, the implementation of trading strategies in place, the success rate and profit and loss ratio to achieve the standard, then the final trading results must be profitable.

The immediate satisfaction of "one profit" is transformed into the delayed satisfaction of "overall profit", and trading will be unbeatable.

## How to maintain a good mood in trading?

### First, it's simple - trade lightly

As long as the light position, even in the case of loss stop, can also maintain a stable state of mind, this time if you encounter a profit, equivalent to the body injected with a tiny electric current, from time to time a small stimulation, trading life will become tasty, not so painful and boring.

Many people in trading like to take heavy positions, especially in trend trading, easy to get huge gains at once, that strong sense of excitement can make people three days and three nights without sleep. But in fact, human nature at its root is greedy for comfort, hoping to live in a stable environment, and constantly have some small sense of excitement to produce a real sense of happiness.

The kind of heavy trading under the great joy and sadness, will bring your emotions to the top, but also your emotions will fall into hell, long-term in this big drop in the mood, will be easy to lose money to stop, forming a vicious circle.

### Second, the distribution of trading results right and wrong as balanced as possible

When setting up a trading system, the success rate should not be too low, for example, 20% success rate means that 80% of the transactions are wrong, even if you have a large profit-loss ratio, but when you have been in a continuous stop-loss, 100 times in the transaction 80 times are stop-loss, you will certainly not be able to stand the collapse.
