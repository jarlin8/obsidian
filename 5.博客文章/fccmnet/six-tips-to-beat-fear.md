Warren Buffett once said that there is no comparison between fear and greed. Fear is an instantaneous, pervasive, intense emotion. Greed, on the other hand, is much slower. Fear is deadly.

So how do you conquer the psychology of fear? The reason why traders develop a fear psychology is actually because they are overly concerned about the performance of the trade results and have high expectations for each trade. So there is also a great deal of fear about the outcome of the trade, especially when there is some uncertainty about the outcome of the trade and more stage fright.

So to overcome the psychology of fear of trading, you can start from three aspects, to increase the degree of control over the results, or reduce the risk of each transaction, of course, the premise is to build the correct perception of the results of the transaction. This can be broken down into six specific methods.

First, the correct perception of the results of the transaction

Even Warren Buffett, but also not necessarily 100% profit. The investment itself has a certain degree of uncertainty, wrong is wrong, as long as the error is admitted to reflect on the summary, wrong is not wrong for nothing.

If you have a fear of losing psychology or can not take the risk, it is impossible to survive in the investment market for a long time. Investment is not work, a work a harvest, itself investment is not fair, may seven points to see the market three points rely on efforts! When the market does not want you to profit, you pay 100 points of effort also useless! Although a little harsh, but who does not want to use leverage to pry ordinary people to build wealth! So, recognize the investment market before investing, the mentality towards losses will be much calmer.

Second, increase the degree of control of the transaction

1, keep abreast of more information to increase their leverage

Whether in the fundamental period, or usual, investment transactions must develop the habit of looking at industry information, you can selectively look at professional news interpretation, but also simply through the 24-hour financial calendar to quickly understand what is happening, will have an impact on their own transactions?

Timely understanding of news and information, trading information so that you do not put yourself in a situation of cover, ignorance is the most terrible for trading. You can't judge trading by just sticking to technical indicators and ignoring the fundamentals and market sentiment you're about to face, otherwise it's only a matter of time before you get slapped in the face by the market!

When you have a certain degree of control over the important information about the transaction, their own transactions are more informed, you will naturally be more confident and less fearful of trading.

2, strict implementation of a set of profitable trading system to enhance their confidence

Because of the uncertainty that leads to panic, so we need some certainty of the conditions plus the probability of success, that is, the strict implementation of their own trading system. While a trading system doesn't necessarily give us a solid win, it's better than nothing.

Just like in the event of an earthquake, those who strictly follow earthquake escape guidelines have a higher probability of surviving. They are also the least likely to panic because they are skilled in earthquake escape guides. Although we don't have a trading escape guide, we do have a trading success book. If you have the treasure code in your hand, you can trade without worry! The more complex the market form, the more you can see the practicality of the trading system!

Three, reduce the risk of trading

1, in the absence of certainty, can be small leverage light position trading

When you carry 10,000 pieces, late at night a person walking in the street, the heart is certainly full of fear; but when you carry 100 pieces, walking strutting, without the slightest worry!

The same goes for trading, when you're not sure, take small leverage and trade light. What's so scary about trading 0.01 lots at a time, with a $1,000 margin, you'll only lose a few dozen to a few hundred dollars at worst. But such a small investment, want to make money is also impossible, can only be said to figure peace of mind, earn a small fortune.

2, set a stop loss to give yourself more room to play

Trading set a stop loss, it is like buying accident insurance, in case of an accident, we are not afraid, naturally can help us reduce the fear of psychology. But the main thing is to set the stop-loss level more reasonable, completely ineffective stop-loss and did not set up no difference.

3, good money management

Money management can help us effectively control the profit loss ratio, have a stronger degree of control over their own funds. According to the size of the market risk, the use of different positions to control losses to a minimum. When we can predict in advance the worst-case scenario, the cost we need to pay, naturally, we will not panic so much.

One last reminder, always take money that does not affect your normal living expenses to invest. That's the first lesson in investing, and everyone needs to remember it! Even if your investment capital is gone, don't try to make it back with the money you have to live on! That will be a bottomless pit!
