Many people are fond of doing multiple varieties of forex trading at the same time, but if you don't know the correlation between currency pairs, it's likely to backfire and increase your trading risk instead.

## What is currency correlation?

Currency correlation literally means that there is some correlation between the movement trends of 2 currency pairs. The exact relationship that exists is divided into 3 categories, same direction, opposite direction or completely random direction.

So how do you determine the correlation of a currency pair? Using the correlation coefficient, the correlation coefficient is a number from -1 to +1.

A correlation coefficient close to or equal to +1 means that the two pairs have a strong positive correlation and they move in the same trend. For example, EUR/USD and GBP/USD, EUR/USD and AUD/USD, AUD/USD and NZD/USD, etc.

A correlation coefficient close to or at -1 indicates that the two pairs have a strong negative correlation, causing them to move in opposite trends. Examples include EUR/USD and USD/CHF, GBP/USD and USD/JPY, USD/JPY and AUD/USD, etc.

A correlation coefficient close to or at 0 indicates that the two pairs are very weakly correlated, or that they move with a stochastic trend.

In general, we can use the Currency Correlation Calculator to calculate the correlation coefficient of 2 currency pairs over a certain time period.

It is worth noting that the currency correlation coefficients are not static and the correlation between the currency pairs can be strong or weak over a period of days, weeks, months, or even years.

There are many reasons that trigger changes in correlations, including changes in a country's interest rates, changes in monetary policy, or any political or economic event that affects the sentiment of currency traders.

## What are the risks associated with currency correlations?

There is a strong link between currency correlation and risk management, and it is important to make sure you understand your exposure when trading multiple currency pairs simultaneously in your trading account. It may be that you think you can diversify your risk by trading multiple currency pairs, unbeknownst to you, many currency pairs tend to move in the same direction and lose money all at once.

For example, in most cases, trading AUD/USD and NZD/USD is basically like opening two identical trades, as they usually have a positive correlation. By buying (or selling) both currency pairs at the same time, you're actually exposing yourself to more risk without realizing it. When you buy 1 lot of AUD/USD and NZD/USD at the same time you are exposing yourself to 2 lots of AUD/USD.

But when you buy 2 currency pairs with negative correlations at the same time, it doesn't mean that the risk can be offset to 0, because the spreads of the different pairs are different. In this case, because one pair eats up the interest of the other, you are likely to not only pay twice the spread, but also potentially minimize your gains or even lose money.

## How do we trade with currency correlations?

### First, we need to avoid trading with strong negative correlations

When trading multiple currency pairs, I must avoid trading 2 pairs with negative strong correlations at the same time. Because these 2 currency pairs move in opposite trends, if you open a position long or short of these 2 currency pairs, then a gain is bound to be a loss.

If you are long one and short the other, it is even more meaningless. The price movement of these 2 is one up, and the other down, once you do it wrong you will lose everything.

### Second, the use of strong positive correlation trading to increase leverage

Trading 2 strongly positively correlated currency pairs at the same time will allow you to double your position and magnify your profits. For example, there is a strong positive correlation between the EUR/USD and GBP/USD relationship, EUR/USD up significantly, at this time, if the two groups of currency pairs on each open a long, in fact, equivalent to doubling the size of the EUR/USD position. But if the judgment error, but also to bear the risk of multiples.

### Third, we have to use positive correlation trading to spread the risk

Note that the positive correlation here is not a strong positive correlation. Using the correlation of currencies, you can spread the risk into two pairs that move in the same way, instead of always trading a single currency pair.

### Fourth, confirming trade entry and exit signals

Using currency correlations, you can also confirm trade entry and exit signals. For example, EUR/USD seems to be testing an important support level. You spot this price behavior and intend to go short on a breakout to the downside. Since you know that EUR/USD is positively correlated with GBP/USD and negatively correlated with USD/CHF and USD/JPY, you can check your judgment by watching for changes in these three currency pairs that echo EUR/USD.

If GBP/USD is trading near an important support level, while both USD/CHF and USD/JPY are trading at important resistance levels. This tells you that the recent movement is related to the US dollar, thus confirming that a breakout in EUR/USD is possible, as the movements in the other three pairs match it and can be chosen to trade when it occurs.

Assuming that the prices of the other three pairs do not move in correspondence to the correlation with the EUR/USD, then there is a chance that this is a false breakout here and it is not advisable to take any chances.
