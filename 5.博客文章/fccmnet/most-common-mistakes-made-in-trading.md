All forex investors will inevitably make mistakes in the process, some mistakes are harmless, while some mistakes may trigger a domino effect, today I will introduce you to several of the most common mistakes made in forex trading and give solutions.

## Mistake 1: frequent trading, emotional trading

This is a mistake that many investors make, and is the mistake that loses the most money. The market is constantly fluctuating, the k-line is constantly jumping, this fast pace is very easy to get on the head, very addictive, and when your own hard-earned money in the head up and down, not many people are able to carry the temptation and pressure.

Solution to the problem.

First, and the market to maintain a certain distance, do not always in front of the computer or mobile phone to stare at the plate, you can hang a good single, set a good stop loss and profit, and set a little after the alarm, go to do other things, such as sports, reading, watching TV is also OK. The eye is not bothered, the market fluctuations on our emotional impact will not be so big.

Second, be sure to develop your trading plan, to establish their own trading system, according to your trading strategy to implement, you can circumvent the problem of haphazard trading, frequent trading, that is, in your disorderly trading world, develop your own rules, and comply with the rules.

## Mistake 2: Abandoning your own judgment and following others in trading

Many people in making transactions, like to refer to other people's transactions, to see who is more profitable today, who's market analysis is accurate, who's trading technology is stronger, who sunshine single more exciting, keen to climb in the group of various, discussion. In fact, this is the most unjust loss, because as long as the exchange with others, others' ideas will always more or less influence your own judgment, which is very detrimental to the consistency of the transaction.

For example, when a certain person after a few consecutive profitable orders, you are in a continuous loss, the mood is already bitter, see others have been in the profit more depressed, but also think that this person is too powerful, want to lick the face to chat with people, hope that the other party can take their own, but really follow this person to do transactions, but encountered a continuous stop loss.

Then again, for example, originally you already have a judgment on the direction, but found that most people in the group with their own judgment point of view is not consistent, if this time and then the gods speak, then the probability is that you will fall back, it is easy to give up their original judgment, the results of the day's market and your original judgment, the original profit of the day became a loss of the day, regret to scratch hair, but it does not help.

Problem solution.

First of all, not to mention the program, first of all, to popularize the "trading atheism". There is no god in the world of trading, no one can predict how the market will go tomorrow, if someone says he can really predict, then he must be trying to figure out what you.

In fact, after so many years of trading, it turns out that what you do is a probability. You standardize all the trading rules, optimize the profit/loss ratio and win rate until you reach the highest profit you can make within your limits, and then resolutely execute your own trading strategy, which in the end will be profitable.

Trading is something you need to sink your teeth into and do well, don't make your mind too restless.

## Mistake 3: Taking a heavy position and overestimating your tolerance

In the transaction we may have had such experience, sometimes encounter a very good trading opportunity, you can not help but want to add a position, but after entering the market found that the market did not go in the direction they expected, their account floating losses began to slowly become larger, the heart began to drum, afraid that in case of a wrong stop is a big loss, so tangled hesitation for a long time, or did not resist closing the position, the results The market suddenly reversed out of the desired direction, the original money can be earned but fell to a loss of the end.

In fact, the vast majority of problems in the transaction are in the position, as long as the position does not exceed their tolerance, the execution of the transaction can be greatly improved, basically will not appear emotional state of control.

Heavy positions, although behind the greater temptation to benefit, but also accompanied by greater risk, if light positions can make money, even if it is a small amount of money, but also to make money, this truth we should think about understanding.

Problem solution.

First, we have to approve light trading from the bottom of our hearts, we would rather earn less than lose big.

Secondly, we have to re-evaluate our psychological tolerance, usually we think feasible position, our real tolerance is actually less than 30%, you think you can carry 10 lots of orders profit and loss fluctuations, then your psychological tolerance may only be 3 lots.

When testing your limits, use a small position to slowly add up, and if you feel a lot of psychological pressure, go back a notch until you find a position you are relatively comfortable with.
