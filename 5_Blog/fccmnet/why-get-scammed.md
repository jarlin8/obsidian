## Stop your imagination

Are they not smart enough? Or are the scammers too skilled at conning? How do these scammers capture human weaknesses? The only way to take the first step towards avoiding being scammed is to gain a deeper understanding of these scam psychologies and achieve effective scam prevention!

Stop your imagination! It's the "Halo Effect"!

In all 'pig slaughter' scams, fraudsters like to package themselves as 'rich and handsome,' 'beautiful and wealthy,' and the frequency of the identity 'brother soldier' is also very high. In this process, the halo effect plays an important role, that is, when you like and trust someone, they are right no matter what they do.

Why do con artists always easily take your money out of your pocket?

Why are many highly educated elites still being scammed?

Because con artists are well versed in human nature and psychology! Every time-tested scam trick must be based on classic psychological principles, trapping people and making them unable to extricate themselves. To avoid being cheated, you must always stay alert and also have some basic knowledge of psychology.

## The halo effect used in scams

The halo effect, which has been abused in telecommunication scams, is also known as the halo effect, the halo effect, etc. Simply put, it is the impression of one aspect of someone that is likely to be mistaken for his other impressions. The main psychological reason for the halo effect is that, in addition to being related to the fact that people have too little information about the other party, it is mainly the result of personal subjective generalization, expansion, and stereotyping. The halo effect often tends to form people's prejudices or biases and has adverse consequences, but sometimes these prejudices or biases are used by people.

Many people who fall into impersonating American soldiers and other sexual scams will blame themselves after sobering up: I haven't even seen the other person's face, why would I think he is the American general who was born and died in the Iraq war and bring me a fortune?

In fact, the reason why impersonating American soldiers and other scams are popular worldwide is because the person who designed this scam script used the 'halo effect' in psychology. To put it simply, it is to generalize and to use the old saying "a lover's eyes are blind." That is to say, a particularly prominent advantage of the other party makes us fall in love and ignore the correct cognition of other characteristics, but instead create a perfect image through this prominent advantage.

The "persona packaging" in scams fully utilizes the halo effect

Psychological studies have shown that people often have an implicit preference for individuals who are good-looking, enthusiastic, and have certain abilities (this instinctive preference can also affect your attitude). Con artists also often use such personas to attract the other party, so in all 'pig slaughter' scams, fraudsters like to package themselves as 'rich and handsome,' 'beautiful and wealthy,' and the frequency of the identity 'brother soldier' is also very high. In this process, the halo effect (Halo Effect) plays an important role, that is, when you like and trust someone, they are right no matter what they do. This lays a good foundation for deep communication in the next step.

When you think about it, isn't impersonating American soldiers a scam? After the other party adds you as a friend, they send you a few pictures of the battlefield, pictures of fighting jets, and pictures of heroic killing enemies, which make you feel that the American soldiers living in movies and TV are really chatting with you. Their heroic temperament conquered your teenage heart, and without understanding their other aspects, you have imposed all your perfect imagination of American soldiers on this scammer and secretly promised yourself to him.

Stop your speculation! We should all learn to avoid being "dazzled". The dizzying effect easily traps us in our own minds, preventing us from seeing the quality and overall context of others or work, leading to misunderstandings and misconceptions. Therefore, when encountering strangers expressing love, be careful not to be blinded by a "halo". Remember to think more calmly about why you are so easily caught by "rich handsome men" and "white rich beauties". Many "pig slaughter" begin with online dating and end in investment fraud. Therefore, when strangers suddenly show interest and concern for you, you must maintain a cautious attitude, think more from their perspective, and consider whether you would suddenly be interested in and willing to communicate with and make money with a stranger. If you are discovered to be a victim of fraud, you should immediately stop the loss, report the crime, and submit an exposure on our website to prevent more people from being deceived.

Is it difficult for you to make a deposit? It's all because of the "split house effect"! The so-called "split house effect" is when one party initially makes a large request and the other party refuses. Then, a smaller, lesser request is made, at which point the other party feels guilty for refusing the first request and agrees. In fact, when it comes to financial matters, most people are wary, and scammers widely use the "split house effect" to gradually undermine the psychological defenses of the victim.

There are many fraud victims who are heartbroken and full of doubts after being cheated: when the fraudster asked for "deposit" they were obviously very cautious, even at first they refused each other, but why would they somehow agree to the fraudster's "deposit" request later, and finally But why did you somehow agree to the scammer's "deposit" request and finally fall into the other party's fraudulent trap step by step?

In fact, it is not that the victim is too stupid, but that the fraudsters understand the psychological characteristics of ordinary people and use the "house-breaking effect" to attack the victim's psychological defenses step by step!

## What is the "house-breaking effect"? What is its role in fraud?

"For example, if you say that the room is too dark and open a skylight here, people will definitely not allow it, but if you advocate tearing down the roof, they will come to They're willing to open a skylight."

So the "tearing down the roof effect" is when one party first makes a big request and the other party refuses; then makes a smaller, lesser request, and the other party, feeling sorry for refusing the first request, agrees. In fact, the vast majority of people are wary when it comes to financial transactions, and fraudsters make extensive use of the "house-breaking effect" to dismantle the victim's psychological defences step by step.

For example, in the well-known "piggy bank" fraud, the fraudster after the emotional pavement to introduce the victim to a "financial investment platform", the fraudster often first let the victim invest into the gold, and after the victim refused to offer the victim to help operate, the victim in order to maintain The victim, in order to maintain the relationship with the scammer, in the previous refusal of the other party's apologetic psychology so they agreed to comply. In the process of helping to operate, the victim will test the rising profit figures on the account, in the role of greed gradually lose their minds and thus hooked.

 **Fraudsters use the "house-breaking effect" to break through victims' psychological defenses**

The case of fraud has been exposed by my station, there are many black platforms using the "housebreaking effect" for fraud cases.

Ms. Wu met the scammer Zhangmou on the shake, after a period of contact between the two developed into an ambiguous relationship, Zhangmou then invited Ms. Wu to invest together to earn big money. The first thing you need to do is to be careful. The company's main goal is to provide the best possible service to its customers.

Ms. Lei met the scammer on the Internet, the scammer shushed Ms. Lei, and soon after that a relationship was established. The scammer then began to invite Ms. Lei to invest money together, but the cautious Ms. Lei refused. The scammer then lowered the requirements, said Ms. Lei can first learn to observe, feel reliable and feasible then invest, so Ms. Lei agreed to the scammer requirements, into a group of investment. Ms. Lei saw people in the group constantly investment profits and screenshots to show off, she also gradually began to sway, and later in the fraudster's lure many times into the gold, a total of 870,000 yuan fraud.

From the above case study can be seen, for the target victims who are more vigilant, the "house demolition effect" is the fraudsters are invariably a powerful tool to break the defense, silently let the target victims fall into step by step without knowing.

## **How to deal with the "housebreaking effect" and avoid being scammed**

In the face of fraudsters using the "housebreaking effect" to crack their own vigilance, in a passive state and full of trust in fraudsters, uninformed investors are actually difficult to have a more effective ability to stop, but it is not insurmountable.

First of all, investors should establish a firm sense of prevention in their daily lives, and be extremely vigilant when it comes to investment and financial management, fund transfers and other related matters.

Secondly, once they are aware that they are being cheated, they should immediately stop the transfer of funds, and at the same time, they should quickly collect evidence and report to the police to defend their rights while making false accusations with the fraudsters.

Finally, the most fundamental method is not blindly follow the unknown financial investment projects, do not blindly believe, check the details of the investment platform before the deposit, choose the regular platform investment.

Learn to cut off your arm to survive! Don't let "sunk cost" drag you down! It can be said that wherever there are weaknesses in human nature, there will be scams, and "sunk cost" tests our deep-seated fears and self-esteem. We are all afraid of being proven wrong, and to alleviate this pain, we would rather continue to adhere to our original wrong decisions. The "unwillingness" caused by the disproportionate cost and gain leads people to be trapped in the black hole of "sunk cost" and unable to extricate themselves.

Why is it that when we are caught in a scam, we can't stop when we know we are losing out? Allowing those funds that have already gone down the drain to inflict new damage on ourselves?

In fact, many investors who have been scammed end up losing all their money because instead of pausing their actions after losing money, they continue to invest in an attempt to catch up with their losses. They do not know that the decision to struggle to make, gritting their teeth to add positions, are calculated by the scammers, this is the "sunk cost" trap.

##  The "sunk cost" of applied psychology of scams

The "sunk cost" trap is often widely used in scams. It is a type of irrational behavior that refers to the fact that once people have invested money or time in something, they show a great tendency to continue to invest. Essentially it lies in the fact that people will always consider historical costs incurred in the past and unrecoverable costs when making decisions about current or future events, such as being motivated to continue with a current investment decision because they cannot afford to lose their previous investment.

Contextually, if an undesirable decision invites severe punishment, the person will often put off the failed project indefinitely, at least to avoid being punished, despite the lack of results. Many psychologists, therefore, attribute the main cause of sunk costs to "loss aversion". But the more you fear loss, the more you lose. So the more you initially invest in a project, the more likely you are to fall into the sunk cost trap.

Put in the field of financial investment, every investment is also a sunk cost, if you fail to generate revenue, re-entry is not necessarily back to the capital, not to mention the investment encounter scams, replenish the position will only lose more miserable.

## **Step by step! The Ghostly "Sunk Costs" of Investment Scams**

Where there is human weakness, so to speak, there is a scam, and the "sunk cost" tests our deepest fears and self-esteem. We are all afraid of being proven wrong, and to ease the pain, we prefer to stick with the wrong decision in the first place. The "unwillingness" caused by the disproportion between what we give and what we get makes people fall into the black hole of "sunk costs". In the end, it's not the scammers' tricks that are so powerful, but the fact that it's hard to kill the capital we've already invested.

Obviously, the investment sector is the hardest hit by the "sunk cost" trap. In many cases of investment fraud, the losses are further compounded by the victims' blind trust in each other and the inability to part with their initial investment in time.

The fraudsters use the "matchmaking" excuse to meet the victim, falsely claiming to be experienced in investment and guiding the operation to make a steady profit without loss, leading the victim to taste the "sweetness" of investment after a small amount of trial operation. The victim was encouraged to invest a total of more than 1.2 million, because it is difficult to give up the account of the huge amount of principal and profit, and even concealed family members ran to borrow money to top up, and eventually a huge debt.

And in another exposed case, the victim was trapped into the gold, at first in order to withdraw the doubled nearly ten times the profit, one after another to pay the deposit, recharge to improve the credit score, but wait until the smashed into the principal more and more, and finally more reluctant to close, in the face of the endless set of scammers, can only lose hundreds of thousands ...... of dollars for nothing

In fact, in front of any choice, those unrecoverable energy, time, and even money, should never be the reason for us to invest more.

## **Invest wisely! Refuse to be held hostage by "sunk costs"!**

Because of the prevalence of scams involving "sunk costs", the issue of sunk costs is currently not perfectly handled by even the best investment experts in the world. This, coupled with the fact that scammers are almost always trained, rehearsed and practiced in a specialized way, makes it very difficult for the average person to deal with them.

first, be alert and recognize the scam early, so you can end it early;
